                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <a class="translation" href="../About/about-us-kor.html">한국어</a><br>
                    <p>“…whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
                        (Matthew 25:40) <br><br>


                        Good Neighbor Ministry is a community of volunteers that brings praise and worship to the
                        residents and patients of
                        nursing homes, senior citizen’s centers and hospitals. All believers are called to be
                        worshippers of the Lord.
                        Hence, the ministry’s aim is to bring people into the very presence of the Lord regardless of
                        their circumstances,
                        and our primary purpose is to give God the glory, honor and praise He deserves.<br><br>


                        Good Neighbor Ministry first stepped into a nursing home in June of 1999 with four volunteers,
                        and with God’s
                        amazing grace, we now serve at 24 facilities in Bergen and Passaic County and have over 200
                        volunteers. Each hour
                        visit consists of a time of hymnal singing, prayer, and a short message shared from the
                        Bible.<br><br>


                        Good Neighbor Ensemble, a youth musical group within the organization, holds numerous musical
                        performances at the
                        various nursing home sites throughout the year. Talented student performers come from all over
                        the Bergen
                        County.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>WHY</h4>
                    <p>All too often, residents of nursing homes do not experience meaningful worship. Many of them live
                        in their facilities for years without having the opportunity to become partakers of a worshiping
                        community. Through Good Neighbor Ministry, however, volunteers bring “church” to them weekly.
                        Despite having challenges in the past, the ministry has continued to grow and reaches not only
                        the resident, but also the volunteer and the nursing home staff.<br><br></p>

                    <h4>WHO</h4>
                    <p>Good Neighbor Ministry is blessed to have a team of committed worship leaders, musicians, and
                        volunteers. Moreover, through the generous support, donation, and prayers from many church
                        congregations, pastors and corporate sponsors, the Good Neighbor Ministry continues to change
                        the lives of many through sharing the gospel message of love.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <h4>VISION + VALUES</h4>
                    <p>“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.” (Psalm 150:6)<br><br>


                        Good Neighbor Ministry is a non-profit corporation that seeks to provide companionship to the
                        elderly through a time of singing, choruses, musical concerts, conversation and fellowship. As
                        of April 2017, 24 different facilities throughout Bergen and Passaic County partake in our
                        services. Nevertheless, should more nursing homes ask for our services, the ministry will strive
                        to meet their needs.<br><br>


                        Good Neighbor Ensemble, a youth musical group within the organization holds weekly musical
                        performances. Therefore, members of this ensemble must be able to adapt and adjust to the rigor
                        of the performance schedule while maintaining a healthy school life. Many of the ensemble
                        members are honor students who continue to perform beyond their years at Good Neighbor Ensemble
                        and come back as mentors and performers at benefit concerts all the while learning the
                        importance of serving their community.<br><br>


                        Our mission of service extends beyond the borders of our community. Through the Good Neighbor
                        Ministry’s annual benefit concerts, we have supported orphanages in Haiti, contributed funds to
                        help the victims of the Nepal earthquake and the Asia tsunami, and assisted refugees from North
                        Korea. And it is our goal, through our partnerships, to continue to effect positive change in
                        our local and global community.<br><br></p>
